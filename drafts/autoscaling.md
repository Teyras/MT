- hard stuff, we must predict future load
- rule-based policies don't apply to use
- the paper on autoscaling performance evaluation has a lot of probabilistic 
  model checking mumbo-jumbo and only focuses on rule-based policies, but their 
  measurement framework could be useful, as well as the metrics they usecould be 
  useful, as well as the metrics they use
- IDEA - configurable price for adding a VM and another for doubling the 
  expected time to complete the current load
