## Analysis

- description of ReCodEx, how machines are selected for jobs (headers etc.)
- TODO should we justify this choice somehow? using it is a part of the thesis 
  assignment
- the most important thing is to minimize the waiting times for users
- TODO forward link to Docker section? it will justify some of our workload 
  choices (thanks to Docker, most workers know how to do everything)

### Why Simulation?
- we could bring the whole system up, but it would mean measuring network delays 
  and similar stuff too, which does not have anything to do with the efficiency 
  of scheduling
