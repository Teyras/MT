## Analysis

- ReCodEx is basically a public CI server with square wheels (frontend, time and 
  memory measurements)
- Exercise authors should be able to create/update runtime environments easily 
  (review process?)
- Installing and updating runtime environments should require zero intervention 
  from administrators
